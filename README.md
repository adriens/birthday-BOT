# Goal

The goal of this project is to make a  "BOT" that wishes happy birthday, on a dedicated channel.

***NB : As integration is made thanks to a Webhook, you don't have to add an app to your Slack Team... good for people who are
using free plans on Slack.***

# Requirements

To make this integration operational, all you need is :

- A slack Webhook url dedicated to the  ```birthdays``` channel (private or public)
- A Giphy API token
- A place to run your daily Job ([Travis cron jobs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/) is a good place to do that so all your stuff is in the cloud)...but you can run it wherever you like
- A csv file that contains birthdays data (please take a look at ```data/birthdays.csv``` to get a running example)
- A ```maven``` runtime (to make things easier to run ...)

All of these items are available for free.

# Setup birthdays csv (flat) database

It's all in ```data/birthdays.csv``` : 

- ```username``` and ```dob``` are mandatory,
- ```username``` must be unique
- ```dob``` is in format ```YYYY-MM-DD```

# Command line

If your are using default csv file (```data/birthdays.csv```), just run :

```mvn exec:java -DgiphyApiKey=YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY -DslackWebhookUrl=YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL```

If you want to use a custom csv file use the fully qualified command line :

```mvn exec:java -DcsvFileName=CSV_FILENAME_PATH -DgiphyApiKey=YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY -DslackWebhookUrl=YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL```

# How to get slack incoming webhook url

First, install the ```Incoming WebHooks``` app : https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks
Configure it to target the ```birthdays``` channel
Keep the url and keep it secret

# Deployment instructions

You can set in up localy on your workstation, on a server but...the best way is to deploy i ton the cloud...
and Travis CI can help, see dedicated section for that.

# Tips

To better manage birthdays greetings, you can create a dedicated branch and
cron job only on that branch ;-p ...hence you are ready to perform PR on the project.

Take care to schedule cron in the middle of the morning to get the best effect :
it's muc more fun to get a live slack than to discover on when you
arrive at the office : nothing beats the Slack "tac tac" with a punching GIF !
